React Router Dom:
Not a essential core part of react it is 3rd party library

# Loader(React-Router):

1. A loader in react-router is a function that is used to fetch data for a route before it is rendered.
2. When you click on a link which directs you to a route, the loader function runs and gets the data ready for the route before it renders.

# React-router-dom libraries:

1. RouterProvider: Helps to provide routes which takes the parameter "router".
2. Outlet: Help to render between the routes keeping header & footer constant.
3. Link: help to navigate to reach destination route usin parameter "to".
4. NavLink: Provides some extra features over Link eg., showing active route using parameter "isActive" & "to".
5. useParams: hook to capture parameter of URL.
